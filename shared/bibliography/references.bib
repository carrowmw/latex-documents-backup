  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of autonomous and resource-limited devices. The devices cooperate to monitor one or more physical phenomena within an area of interest. WSNs operate as stochastic systems because of randomness in the monitored environments. For long service time and low maintenance cost, WSNs require adaptive and robust methods to address data exchange, topology formulation, resource and power optimization, sensing coverage and object detection, and security challenges. In these problems, sensor nodes are used to make optimized decisions from a set of accessible strategies to achieve design goals. This survey reviews numerous applications of the Markov decision process (MDP) framework, a powerful decision-making tool to develop adaptive algorithms and protocols for WSNs. Furthermore, various solution methods are discussed and compared to serve as a guide for using MDPs in WSNs.},

  abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only 'traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

  abstract = {For many KDD applications, such as detecting criminal activities in E-commerce, finding the rare instances or the outliers, can be more interesting than finding the common patterns. Existing work in outlier detection regards being an outlier as a binary property. In this paper, we contend that for many scenarios, it is more meaningful to assign to each object a degree of being an outlier. This degree is called the local outlier factor (LOF) of an object. It is local in that the degree depends on how isolated the object is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood. We give a detailed formal analysis showing that LOF enjoys many desirable properties. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that LOF can be used to find outliers which appear to be meaningful, but can otherwise not be identified with existing approaches. Finally, a careful performance evaluation of our algorithm confirms we show that our approach of finding local outliers can be practical.},

To solve this problem, this paper proposes a novel minimal rare pattern-based outlier detection approach, namely Constrained Minimal Rare Pattern-based Outlier Detection (CMRP-OD), to discover outliers from small sets of \$UDS\$ that satisfy the user-preset succinct or convertible monotonic constraints. First, two concepts of `maximal probability' and `support cap' are proposed to compress the scale of extensible patterns, and then the matrix is designed to store the information of each valid pattern to reduce the scanning times of \$UDS\$, thus decreasing the time consumption. Second, more factors that can influence the determination of outlier are considered in the design of deviation indices, thus increasing the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments show that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, CMRP-OD approach has at least 10\% improvement on detection accuracy, and its time cost is also almost reduced half.},

These multiple research areas have created a mix-up between terminology and problems. In some research, similar problems have been named differently; while in some other works, the same term has been used to describe different problems. This confusion between terms and problems causes the repetition of research and hinders the advance of the field. Therefore, a standardization is imperative. The goal of this paper is to underline the differences between each term, and organize the area by looking at all these terms under the umbrella of supervised classification. Therefore, a one-to-one assignment of terms to learning scenarios is proposed. In fact, each learning scenario is associated with the term most frequently used in the literature. In order to validate this proposal, a set of experiments retrieving papers from Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore has been carried out.},

The solution resulted in statistics describing trends in the 'busyness' of various towns and cities in the UK. We validated time series against Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras across North East England, showing a close correlation between our statistical output and the ANPR source. Trends were also favorably compared against traffic flow statistics from the UK's Department of Transport. The results of this work have been adopted as an experimental faster indicator of the impact of COVID-19 on the UK economy and society by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).},

However, if the data cleaning strategies are not correctly designed, it might result in an unsatisfactory cleaning effect with increased system cleaning costs. Initially, data quality evaluation indicators and their measurement methods in wireless sensor networks were introduced. We then explored the impact of relationship between different indicators which are used in the quality assessment. Finally, data cleaning strategy for wireless sensor networks based on the relationship between data quality indicators was proposed by comparing and analyzing data cleaning schemes with different orders. The experimental results showed that the proposed data cleaning strategy can effectively improve data availability and have a better cleaning effect in wireless sensor networks for the same cleaning cost.},

Despite this obvious correlation, there is little research about data quality measurement to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning models. Especially in industrial settings, where sensors produce large amounts of highly volatile data, a one-time measurement of the data quality is not sufficient since errors in new data should be detected as early as possible. Thus, in this paper, we present DaQL (Data Quality Library), a generally-applicable tool to continuously monitor the quality of data to increase the prediction accuracy of machine learning models. We demonstrate and evaluate DaQL within an industrial real-world machine learning application at Siemens.},

  abstract = {High-quality data is key to interpretable and trustworthy data analytics and the basis for meaningful data-driven decisions. In practical scenarios, data quality is typically associated with data preprocessing, profiling, and cleansing for subsequent tasks like data integration or data analytics. However, from a scientific perspective, a lot of research has been published about the measurement (i.e., the detection) of data quality issues and different generally applicable data quality dimensions and metrics have been discussed. In this work, we close the gap between data quality research and practical implementations with a detailed investigation on "how data quality measurement and monitoring concepts are implemented in state-of-the-art tools". For the first time and in contrast to all existing data quality tool surveys, we conducted a systematic search, in which we identified 667 software tools dedicated to "data quality". To evaluate the tools, we compiled a requirements catalog with three functionality areas: (1) data profiling, (2) data quality measurement in terms of metrics, and (3) automated data quality monitoring. Using a set of predefined exclusion criteria, we selected 13 tools (8 commercial and 5 open-source tools) that provide the investigated features and are not limited to a specific domain for detailed investigation. On the one hand, this survey allows a critical discussion of concepts that are widely accepted in research, but hardly implemented in any tool observed, for example, generally applicable data quality metrics. On the other hand, it reveals potential for functional enhancement of data quality tools and supports practitioners in the selection of appropriate tools for a given use case.},

Since traditional approaches configure WSNs statically, their dynamic reconfiguration represents a difficult challenge. To address this challenge, clustering techniques can be integrated into WSNs. In the present paper, we present a comprehensive review of some of the recently proposed clustering protocols (from the year 2003 to 2021) that have been applied to WSNs. In this survey, clustering algorithms are categorized into four classes, namely (1) cluster-based protocols for homogeneous nodes, (2) cluster-based protocols for heterogeneous nodes, (3) clustering protocols based on fuzzy logic methods, and (4) clustering protocols based on heuristic methods. This categorization was carried out based on these protocols' network organization as well as the techniques used for managing the procedures of clustering. For the purpose of evaluating the efficiency of these protocols, we take into account features, performance as well as clustering methodologies as the main parameters used in the comparison of these four categories of clustering approaches.},

Such autonomic IoT applications have minimal human involvement in the decision making and actuation process. A key challenge in developing such autonomic IoT applications is uncertainty in the data produced by the IoT devices with data freshness being a critical aspect. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing Age of Data (AoD), a metric to quantify the freshness of the data produced by IoT devices. We analyse the impact of AoD on IoT applications and propose a model for computing AoD that can be used by IoT applications in the decision making process. We validate the proposed model via experimental evaluations using real-world data obtained from parking sensors. Our analysis found that in real-world scenarios, 21.4\% of sensors provide data that is outdated by several hours. We show that incorporating AoD in the application logic leads to improved application decision making.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates the development of IoT applications in domains such as manufacturing, smart cities, retail, agriculture, etc. Such IoT applications collect data, analyze, and extract insightful information to enable decision-making and actuation. There is an unprecedented growth of IoT applications that automate decision-making and actuation without requiring human intervention, which we term autonomic IoT applications. The increasing scale of such applications necessitates holistic measurement and evaluation of application quality. Existing literature has evaluated quality from an end-user perspective, which may be unsuitable when dealing with the complexity of modern IoT applications, especially when they are autonomic. In this paper, we refer to IoT application quality as the aggregate quantitative value of various IoT quality metrics measured at each stage of the autonomic IoT application life cycle. We present an in-depth survey of current state-of-the-art techniques and approaches for evaluating quality of IoT applications. In particular, we survey various definitions to identify the factors that contribute to understanding and evaluating quality in IoT. Furthermore, we present open issues and identify future research directions towards realizing fine-grained quality evaluation of IoT applications. We envision that the identified research directions will, in turn, enable real-time diagnostics of IoT applications and make them quality-aware. This survey can serve as the basis for designing and developing modern, resilient quality-aware autonomic IoT applications.},

For forecasting, a regression version of the deep Gaussian mixture model (DGMM) is introduced. First, the preliminary clustering based on the finite normal mixtures is performed. This information is then used as an input for some supervised ML algorithm. It is the basic concept of the probability-informed ML approach in the field of telecommunications networks. Using the real-world datasets from a Portuguese mobile operator as well as public cellular traffic data, the article compares this approach with methods such as random forests, support vector machine regression, gradient boosting and LSTM. Vector autoregression, informed by the parameters of the generalized gamma (GG) distribution, which has also been successfully used to reconstruct past traffic patterns, is also used as a benchmark. We demonstrate that DGMM-based regression is 6.82--22.8 times faster than LSTM for the dataset. Moreover, DGMM-based regression can achieve better results for the most important traffic characteristics (average and total traffic, the number of users). For metrics MAPE and RMSE, it surpasses the results of statistical methods up to 46.7\% (RMSE) and 91.5\% (MAPE) (median increases are 28.0\% and 80.1\%, respectively), as well as for ML methods up to 13.0\% (RMSE) and 35.7\% (MAPE) (median increases are 0.39\% and 2.5\%, respectively). Thus, the use of a probability-informed approach for telecommunication data seems optimal for the computational speed and accuracy trade-off. Also, we introduce a novel statistical hypothesis testing method based on GG distribution for detecting suspected anomalies in traffic. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Estimating missing sensor values is an inherent problem in sensor network applications; however, existing data estimation approaches do not apply well to the context of datastreams, a major characteristic of sensornet applications. Additionally, they fail to account for relationships among sensors and simultaneously, incorporate the time factor making the estimation process computationally aware of the relative relevance of each data round in the datastream. To address this gap, we propose a data estimation technique, FARM, which uses association rule mining to discover intrinsic relationships among sensors and incorporate them into the data estimation while taking data freshness into consideration. FARM was tested with data from two real sensornet applications, namely climate sensing and traffic monitoring. Simulation shows that in terms of estimation accuracy, FARM outperformed existing techniques costing only marginally more space and time overheads while scaling well with the network size, thus assuring quality of service for real-time applications.},

In this chapter, classification of data collection protocols are presented with the help of different parameters such as network lifetime, energy, fault tolerance, and latency. To achieve these parameters, different techniques such as multi-hop, clustering, duty cycling, network coding, aggregation, sink mobility, directional antennas, and cross-layer solutions have been analyzed. The drawbacks of these techniques are discussed. Finally, the future work for routing protocols in wireless sensor networks is discussed.},

While advances in individual-level data and computing power have opened up new research avenues, they have also brought with them a new set of challenges. This article reviews some of the challenges that the field has faced, the opportunities available to advance the state-of-the-art, and the outlook for the field over the next decade. We argue that although agent-based models continue to have enormous promise as a means of developing dynamic spatial simulations, the field needs to fully embrace the potential offered by approaches from machine learning to allow us to fully broaden and deepen our understanding of geographical systems.},

  abstract = {The production and storage of kimchi in a factory require monitoring temperature and humidity to maintain optimal quality. Recently, smart packaging devices such as wireless sensors have been used, but their installation and maintenance are costly and require additional resources. In this study, kimchi is packaged in polyethylene packages and placed in plastic baskets. Thirty baskets are stacked in the middle of the storage room. Wireless sensors placed inside the baskets collect temperature data alongside the kimchi for 60 days. The data is sent to a server through communication unit using 4G network. Two clustering algorithms, Competitive Learning Neural Network (CLNN) and k-means, are used to determine the optimal number and location of sensors. Deep learning algorithms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), predict the acidity and ripeness grade of the kimchi. The study found that the optimal number of temperature sensor groups for CLNN was 6 for acidity and 4 for ripeness grade classification. Increasing the number of sensors improved the kimchi acidity prediction, and the accuracy of ripeness classification increased with the number of sensors. The location of the wireless sensors was determined based on the heights of the stacked plastic baskets using the CLNN + LSTM model. This work presents a process for optimizing sensor placement and evaluating kimchi quality during storage and fermentation using clustering and deep learning techniques to maintain optimal quality. {\copyright} 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Missing data is common in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), especially with multi-hop communications. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, such as unstable wireless communications, synchronization issues, and unreliable sensors. Unfortunately, missing data creates a number of problems for WSNs. First, since most sensor nodes in the network are battery-powered, it is too expensive to have the nodes re-transmit missing data across the network. Data re-transmission may also cause time delays when detecting abnormal changes in an environment. Furthermore, localized reasoning techniques on sensor nodes (such as machine learning algorithms to classify states of the environment) are generally not robust enough to handle missing data. Since sensor data collected by a WSN is generally correlated in time and space, we illustrate how replacing missing sensor values with spatially and temporally correlated sensor values can significantly improve the network's performance. However, our studies show that it is important to determine which nodes are spatially and temporally correlated with each other. Simple techniques based on Euclidean distance are not sufficient for complex environmental deployments. Thus, we have developed a novel Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation method that estimates missing data in WSNs by learning spatial and temporal correlations between sensor nodes. To improve the search time, we utilize a kd-tree data structure, which is a non-parametric, data-driven binary search tree. Instead of using traditional mean and variance of each dimension for kd-tree construction, and Euclidean distance for kd-tree search, we use weighted variances and weighted Euclidean distances based on measured percentages of missing data. We have evaluated this approach through experiments on sensor data from a volcano dataset collected by a network of Crossbow motes, as well as experiments using sensor data from a highway traffic monitoring application. Our experimental results show that our proposed K-NN imputation method has a competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art Expectation--Maximization (EM) techniques, while using much simpler computational techniques, thus making it suitable for use in resource-constrained WSNs.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), the adoption of 5G, and progress towards 6G technology have led to the accumulation of massive amounts of real-world data; however, a significant portion of the data generated by smart cities and smart buildings remains unused. A notable problem is the shift of statistical properties in real-world streaming over time caused by unexpected factors, referred to as concept drift, which results in less efficient predictive models. To address this problem, the latest research leverages the cloud--edge continuum paradigm for the deployment of AI and general smart city applications while utilising the available resources optimally. In this article, we propose a computing architecture for different smart city applications in edge micro data centre (EMDC) settings over a hybrid cloud--edge continuum to support the deployment of AI workloads. We implement a feedback-driven automated concept drift detection and adaptation methodology, combining base learner long short-term memory (LSTM) with Page--Hinkley test (PHT), adaptive windowing (ADWIN) and the Kolmogorov--Smirnov windowing (KSWIN). Real-world data streams are utilised to forecast from various environmental sensors installed at the University of Oulu Smart Campus. The feedback-based concept drift detection and adaption process is first evaluated using synthetic datasets with known concept drift points and then employed in the real-world data. Subsequently, the implementation is evaluated using the state-of-the-art MAE, RMSE, and MAPE methods. The results showed a reduction in MAPE from 8.5\% to 3.88\% when concept drift detection was applied. Additionally, the challenges faced and the effectiveness of the suggested solutions are explored.},

Examples of such problems are disruptions in the electric grid and disturbances in the transmission. SG is a premium source of Big Data. The data should be processed to reveal hidden patterns and secret correlations to extrapolate the needed values. Such useful information obtained by the so-called data analytics is an essential element for energy management and control decision towards improving energy security, efficiency, and decreasing costs of energy use. For that reason, different techniques have been developed to process Big Data. This paper presents an overview of these techniques and discusses their advantages and challenges. The contribution of this paper is building a recommender system using different techniques to overcome the most obstacles encountering the Big Data processes in SG. The proposed system achieves the goals of the future SG by (i) analyzing data and executing values as accurately as possible, (ii) helping in decision-making to improve the efficiency of the grid, (iii) reducing cost and time, (iv) managing operating parameters, (v) allowing predicting and preventing equipment failures, and (vi) increasing customer satisfaction. Big Data process enables benefits that were never achieved for the SG application.},

The IoT brings more data than ever before, connecting cyber and physical worlds, which enable people to make better decisions. The very nature of the IoT environment generating giant volumes of data gathered from several heterogeneous sources creates important data quality challenges that need to be addressed. This is because inadequate levels of data quality impact negatively all the working of the IoT network. Despite the fact that data quality has been broadly studied outside the IoT field, and huge standardization efforts are behind the concept, data quality management in the IoT has not been investigated in-depth. This paper presents an approach for managing data quality in 'smart, connected product (SCP)' environments, grounded on the series of international standards ISO/IEC 25000 and ISO 8000. Our approach provides a set of best practices for assessing and improving data quality in such environments.},

An agent-based model's (ABM) complexity grows as the number of parameters required to be calibrated increases. This parameter expansion leads to the ABMS equivalent of the "curse of dimensionality". In particular, infeasible computational requirements searching an infinite parameter space. We propose a more comprehensive and adaptive ABMS Framework. The new framework can effectively swap out parameterisation strategies and surrogate models to parameterise an infectious disease ABM. This framework allows us to evaluate different strategy-surrogate combinations' performance in accuracy and efficiency (speedup). We show that we achieve better than parity in accuracy across the surrogate-assisted sampling strategies and the baselines. Also, we identify that the Metric Stochastic Response Surface strategy combined with the Support Vector Machine surrogate is the best overall in obtaining the actual synthetic parameters. Additionally, we show that DYnamic COOrdindate Search Using Response Surface Models with XGBoost as a surrogate attains one of the highest probabilities at 0.75 of approximating the cumulative synthetic daily infection data achieving a significant speedup of 2.9 with regards to our analysis. Lastly, we show in a real-world setting that DYCORS XGBoost and MSRS SVM can approximate the real-world cumulative daily infection distribution with 97.12\% and 96.75\% similarity, respectively.}

We rank each point on the basis of its distance to its kth nearest neighbor and declare the top n points in this ranking to be outliers. In addition to developing relatively straightforward solutions to finding such outliers based on the classical nested-loop join and index join algorithms, we develop a highly efficient partition-based algorithm for mining outliers. This algorithm first partitions the input data set into disjoint subsets, and then prunes entire partitions as soon as it is determined that they cannot contain outliers. This results in substantial savings in computation. We present the results of an extensive experimental study on real-life and synthetic data sets. The results from a real-life NBA database highlight and reveal several expected and unexpected aspects of the database. The results from a study on synthetic data sets demonstrate that the partition-based algorithm scales well with respect to both data set size and data set dimensionality.},

The integration of these technologies will facilitate the techniques for better decision making and achieve urban growth. However, the existing traffic prediction methods mostly dedicated to highway and urban traffic management, and limited studies focused on collector roads and closed campuses. Besides, reaching out to the public, and establishing active connections to assist them in decision-making is challenging when the users are not equipped with any smart devices. This research proposes an IoT based system model to collect, process, and store real-time traffic data for such a scenario. The objective is to provide real-time traffic updates on traffic congestion and unusual traffic incidents through roadside message units and thereby improve mobility. These early-warning messages will help citizens to save their time, especially during peak hours. Also, the system broadcasts the traffic updates from the administrative authorities. A prototype is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of the model, and the results of the experiments show good accuracy in vehicle detection and a low relative error in road occupancy estimation. The study is part of the Omani-funded research project, investigating Real-Time Feedback for Adaptive Traffic Signals.},

  abstract = {Air pollution is a pervasive environmental and public health concern, prompting the imperative development of predictive systems to facilitate proactive interventions. The complexity of predicting air pollution arises from intricate factors, including the accumulation of pollutants, traffic dynamics, and industrial emissions. Traditional methodologies, reliant on historical or real-time data analysis, often encounter limitations in providing comprehensive and accurate solutions to this multifaceted problem. To address the existing problem, we propose a novel fog-assisted decentralized air quality prediction and event detection system (DeepFogAQ) for managing air pollution of future cities. We integrate Deep Learning (DL), Fog Computing (FC), Complex Event Processing (CEP), and virtualization technologies within the architecture of DeepFogAQ. Specifically, for predicting pollutant concentrations, we employ Transformers, CNN-LSTM, GRU, and RFR models. Additionally, we construct Fog and Cloud layers based on container-based virtualization technology. To demonstrate the feasibility of the system, the developed ML/DL models were run on DeepFogAQ and alarm levels for future air quality were derived. In this way, both the success of the prediction models and the validity of the architecture were ensured. Experimental results showed that Transformers is the most successful model in air quality prediction and event detection. As a result, the proposed DeepFogAQ architecture has the potential to offer a powerful alternative to decision-makers to solve the air pollution problem with its decentralized, scalable, and fault-tolerant structure. {\copyright} 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, a hybrid approach integrating the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM)-based imputation method with the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is develop for missing traffic volume data estimation based on inductance loop detector outputs. By utilizing the weekly similarity among data, the conventional vector-based data structure is firstly transformed into the matrix-based data pattern. Then, the GA is applied to optimize the membership functions and centroids in the FCM model. The experimental tests are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The traffic volume data collected at different temporal scales were used as the testing dataset, and three different indicators, including root mean square error, correlation coefficient, and relative accuracy, are utilized to quantify the imputation performance compared with some conventional methods (Historical method, Double Exponential Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model). The results show the proposed approach outperforms the conventional methods under prevailing traffic conditions.},

  abstract = {Sensor data quality plays a vital role in Internet of Things (IoT) applications as they are rendered useless if the data quality is bad. This systematic review aims to provide an introduction and guide for researchers who are interested in quality-related issues of physical sensor data. The process and results of the systematic review are presented which aims to answer the following research questions: what are the different types of physical sensor data errors, how to quantify or detect those errors, how to correct them and what domains are the solutions in. Out of 6970 literatures obtained from three databases (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect) using the search string refined via topic modelling, 57 publications were selected and examined. Results show that the different types of sensor data errors addressed by those papers are mostly missing data and faults e.g. outliers, bias and drift. The most common solutions for error detection are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) which accounts for about 40\% of all error detection papers found in the study. Similarly, for fault correction, PCA and ANN are among the most common, along with Bayesian Networks. Missing values on the other hand, are mostly imputed using Association Rule Mining. Other techniques include hybrid solutions that combine several data science methods to detect and correct the errors. Through this systematic review, it is found that the methods proposed to solve physical sensor data errors cannot be directly compared due to the non-uniform evaluation process and the high use of non-publicly available datasets. Bayesian data~analysis done on the 57 selected publications also suggests that publications using publicly available datasets for method evaluation have higher citation rates.},

  abstract = {With the booming of the Internet of Things, enormous number of smart devices/sensors have been deployed in the physical world to monitor our surroundings. Usually those devices generate high-dimensional geo-tagged time-series data. However, these sensor readings are easily missing due to the hardware malfunction, connection errors or data corruption, which severely compromise the back-end data analysis. To solve this problem, in this paper we exploit tensor-based Singular Value Decomposition method to recover the missing sensor readings. The main novelty of this paper lies in that, i) our tensor-based recovery method can well capture the multi-dimensional spatial and temporal features by transforming the irregularly deployed sensors into a sensor-array and folding the periodic temporal patterns into multiple time dimensions, ii) it only requires to tune one key parameter in an unsupervised manner, and iii) Tensor Singular Value Decomposition structure is more efficient on representation of high-dimension sensor data than other tensor recovery methods based on tensor's vectorization or flattening. The experimental results in several real-world one-year air quality and meteorology datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach.},

  abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application's design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges.},

Careful node placement can be a very effective optimization means for achieving the desired design goals. In this paper, we report on the current state of the research on optimized node placement in WSNs. We highlight the issues, identify the various objectives and enumerate the different models and formulations. We categorize the placement strategies into static and dynamic depending on whether the optimization is performed at the time of deployment or while the network is operational, respectively. We further classify the published techniques based on the role that the node plays in the network and the primary performance objective considered. The paper also highlights open problems in this area of research.},
