\section{Work Plan}

My \href{https://phd-gantt-chart.de.r.appspot.com/}{work plan} is available as a web-app hosted on Google App Engine (allow up to 10s for the chart to load in). The slippage dropdown show the current estimates in red overlayed on the original estimates. There is also view to show the original timeline and the updated one separately. There is a possibility of a 6-month interruption starting in November that can be toggled on and off. The app was developed as a side project in Python to reinforce my knowledge from my Plotly-Dash course. I have designed the app as a Python package, available on \href{https://github.com/carrowmw/phd-gantt-chart}{my GitHub} intended for use by other PhD students---I found there was a shortage of free and easy-to-use Gantt-(style) charts. This project helped me to understand how to build a Python package following best-practice and I intend to publish it on my \href{https://pypi.org/user/carrowmw/}{PyPi} in the near future.
