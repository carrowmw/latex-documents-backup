        \textbf{Method}               & \textbf{Examples}                                                                                       & \textbf{Description}                                                                                                        \\ \hline
        Rule-based                    & Threshold-based detection, finite state machines, and expert systems.                                   & Simple to implement but may struggle with complex event patterns and adaptability.                                          \\ \hline
        Machine learning              & Supervised learning: decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, etc.

        Unsupervised learning: clustering, anomaly detection, etc.
                                      & Can adapt to complex event patterns but require sufficient labelled data for training.                                                                                                                                                \\ \hline
        Deep learning                 & Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Graph neural networks (GNNs).   & Can handle high-dimensional and unstructured data but require large amounts of training data and computational resources.   \\ \hline
        Statistical and probabilistic & Hidden Markov models (HMMs), Bayesian networks, and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).                     & Can capture the uncertainties and dependencies in event occurrences but may require prior knowledge of event distributions. \\ \hline
        Hybrid                        & Combining rule-based and machine learning methods or integrating deep learning with statistical models. & Can provide more robust and accurate event detection but may increase the complexity of the system.                         \\ \hline
