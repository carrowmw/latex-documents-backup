\section{Research Objectives}

\subsection{Project Objectives}
This research aims to address some of the challenges in reducing human involvement by developing a library that enables the creation of scalable and quality-aware pedestrian data stream pipelines. The library will provide a comprehensive framework for automated data quality assessment, cleaning, and monitoring, empowering end-users to make informed decisions based on reliable and trustworthy sensor data. By ensuring data quality throughout the pipeline, this research seeks to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of automated decision systems in pedestrian activity monitoring.

\subsection{Review Objectives}
The literature review explores the relationship between data quality and WSNs in the context of smart cities, focusing on methodologies for assessing data quality and developing a taxonomy suitable for pedestrian monitoring. The objectives of the literature review are to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Adopt/adapt an existing taxonomy for data quality dimensions in object-detecting wireless sensor networks.
    \item Establish the key themes from the literature for real-time data quality management and monitoring frameworks.
    \item Discuss existing methods for quantifying data quality in IoT networks.
    \item Present existing case studies that have implemented urban data quality management and monitoring pipelines.
\end{itemize}
